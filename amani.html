<p class=tab><font color="black" size="+2">There are numerous and various ways to be safe in the cyber world.  Some ways you can be safe on the internet is by eschewing clicking
 on sites that seem to be scammy. This is consequential because some websites have mendacious advertisement or maybe even deplorable grammar pop ups; if these end up being clicked on it can often cause
 your computer to crash. <strong>Clearing all of your browsing data</strong> to forfend your privacy is paramount as well, many websites that you have located in your history makes it facile for sites to have
 access to your cookie.
  Cookies record everything that you have in your history and can visually perceive your personal information what you explore on the internet, to present germane ads on your computer screen while you are browsing the
 internet. However, this can be unsafe because sometimes hackers can get access to your history and can see your personal information.<strong> Do online shopping on reliable and certified websites</strong>, utilize
 private WiFi networks, sign up for accounts on certified and real websites along with a strong password, and be sure to log out of all accounts online after using them.</font></p>
